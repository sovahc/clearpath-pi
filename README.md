This is my code for controlling Clearpath motor with Raspberry Pi Pico using TinyUSB host

I need velocity and position control for my mini lathe, so I reverse engineered part of the protocol.

Now I can use my lathe spindle as a dividing head.

I posted this code so that you have a better starting point if you also want to interact with the motor via usb.
